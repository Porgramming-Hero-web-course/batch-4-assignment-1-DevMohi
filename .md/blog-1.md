#### The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

Union and Intersection types both play different roles in Typescript. Union types act as an OR (|) operator which provides flexibility by allowing a variable to hold one or several specified types for instance:

type Role = "user" | "admin"

Here the example can be seen that Union type helps typecript to choose either one role that is "user" or "admin" , union type also ensures helping avoid errors by making sure only valid values are used and no other values can be inserted apart from this.

Intersection type acts as an (&) operator which combine multiple types into one , what this does is it follows the and(&) rule which needs to satisfy multiple requirements for instance:

type Person = {name :string};
type Student = {id: number};
type StudentProfile = Person & Student; -> When creating the student profile you will need to include both name and id.
